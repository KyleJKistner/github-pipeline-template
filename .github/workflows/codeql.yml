# CodeQL Security Scanning Workflow
#
# Performs static analysis to find security vulnerabilities in code.
#
# This workflow is GATED:
# - Public repositories: Enabled by default
# - Private repositories: Requires vars.CODEQL_ENABLED=true
#   (Also requires GitHub Advanced Security license)
#
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages
