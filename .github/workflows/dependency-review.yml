# Dependency Review Workflow
#
# Scans dependency changes in pull requests for:
# - Known security vulnerabilities
# - License compliance issues
#
# Note: This action requires:
# - Public repositories: Works out of the box
# - Private repositories: Requires GitHub Advanced Security license
#   and dependency graph to be enabled
#
# For private repos without GHAS, this workflow will be skipped.
#
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review
